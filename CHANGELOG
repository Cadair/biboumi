Version 2.0
 - Support PING requests in all directions
 - Improve the way we forward received NOTICEs by remembering to
   which users we previously sent a private message.  This improves the
   user experience when talking to NickServ.
 - Support joining key-protected channels
 - Setting a participant's role/affiliation now results in a change of IRC
   mode, instead of being ignored.  Setting Toto's affiliation to admin is
   now equivalent to “/mode +o Toto”

Version 1.1                                             2014-16-07
