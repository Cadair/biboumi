 Dependencies
==============

Build and runtime dependencies:

Tools:

- A C++14 compiler (clang >= 3.4 or gcc >= 4.9 for example)
- CMake
- ronn (optional) to build the man page

Libraries:

- expat
 Used to parse XML from the XMPP server.
 http://expat.sourceforge.net/

- libiconv
 Encoding from anything into UTF-8
 http://www.gnu.org/software/libiconv/

- libuuid
 Generate unique IDs
 http://sourceforge.net/projects/libuuid/

- libidn (optional, but recommended)

 not provided.
 http://www.gnu.org/software/libidn/

- libbotan 1.11 (optional)
 Provides TLS support. Without it, IRC connections are all made in
 plain-text mode.
 Other branches than the 1.11 are not supported.
 http://botan.randombit.net/

- systemd-daemon (optional)
 Provides the support for a systemd service of Type=notify. This is useful only
 if you are packaging biboumi in a distribution with Systemd.


==============
  Configure
==============

Configure the build system using cmake, there are many solutions to do that,
the simplest is to just run

% cmake .

in the current directory

You can also configure many parameters of the build (like customize CFLAGS,
the install path, choose the compiler, or enabling some options like the
POLLER to use), using:

% ccmake .

In ccmake, first use 'c' to configure the build system, edit the values you
need and finaly use 'g' to generate the Makefiles to build the system and
quit ccmake.

or

% cmake -i .

and respond to the questions when you are prompted to.

You can, for example, select the poller used by biboumi, at compile-time,
using the POLLER cmake option.  Available values are:
 EPOLL: use the Linux-specific epoll(7). This is the default on Linux.
 POLL: use the standard poll(2). This is the default value on all non-Linux platforms.

Example, configure the poller with cmake:
% cmake . -DPOLLER=EPOLL
